## Project

Our project consists of a simulation of the pedestrian traffic in Trindade's station, where the trains arrive and depart from the station, and the passengers enter and leave the trains. The simulation is done using [NetLogo](https://simpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

You can find the report in [here](docs/Report), the presentation [here](docs/Presentation) and a demonstrative video [here](docs/demo.mp4).
